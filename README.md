# EngineDX11
This is were I am going to be working on a game engine using DirectX11. <br>
I am still in the process of learning how everyhing works, so don't expect anything at all ;)

Current list of features:
- Loading and rendering 3D Models
- Textures
- Little menu with IMGUI
- Directional light
- Walking and looking around
- Terrain

TODO:
- Different types of light
- Shadows
- Text/GUI rendering
- Sound
- More complicated terrain (e.g. heightmaps)
